                    As an international student hailing from the vibrant culture of Japan, this site serves as <br />
                    a digital gateway to who I am and what I'm passionate about. <br />
                    Dive into my bio to get to know me on a personal level, explore my academic journey at SFU, and <br />
                    discover the unique blend of experiences that shape my worldview. <br />
                    Connect with me through various media links, and join the journey <br />
                    as we bridge cultures and share perspectives. <br />
                    This space is not just about me; it's a platform for us to connect, explore, <br />
                    and share in the rich tapestry of experiences that make up this exciting chapter of my life.
